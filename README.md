# portaudiopp
Comprehensive Modern c++ wrapper for PortAudio. Tested on Linux and Windows. And if I can ever afford one, a MAC.
This library requires at least C++17 standard, and is built using CMake.

You can use the system Portaudio on Linux if you wish, but the source and build files are included here for convenience.
I developed this using VSCode on Linux Mint 19.
